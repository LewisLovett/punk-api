With the punk api you can filter through a list of Beer Objects

Each Beer card lists

2. An image of the beer unless it is keg only
3. A short description of the beer

You can enter the beer name into the search box and the list finds the matching beer card.
You can also enable checkboxes to filter by alcohol by volume (ABV), if the beer is part of the classic range (before 2010) and
