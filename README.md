Punk API

With the punk api you can filter through a list of Beer Objects

Each Beer card lists
1. The Beer name
2. An image of the beer unless it is keg only
3. A short description of the beer

You can enter the beer name into the search box and the list finds the matching beer card.
You can also enable checkboxes to filter by alcohol by volume (ABV), if the beer is part of the classic range (before 2010) and 
if the beer has high acidity (ph Lower than 4). Each of there filters can be used together and with the search box.
